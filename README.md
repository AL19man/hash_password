# hash_password

Application created to enhance password security verification. Developed using C++ and widely used hash and OpenSSL libraries within Linux operating systems.
The main concept is to avoid storing the actual password in the application's code, instead storing only the hash code of the password.
Password verification is performed solely based on the hash code, preventing attackers from extracting the password directly from the application's code. 
In future versions, the application will be further updated to include security measures against hash brute-force attacks. Currently, 
the focus is on implementing anti-debugging tools for enhanced security.
